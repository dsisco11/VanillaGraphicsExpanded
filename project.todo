LumOn Functional Test Coverage:
    Phase 1 - High Priority:
      ✔ LumOnProbeTraceFunctionalTests.cs - SH-based ray tracing (mirror octahedral variant tests) @done
      ✔ LumOnTemporalOctahedralFunctionalTests.cs - Octahedral temporal blending @done
    Phase 2 - Medium Priority:
      ✔ LumOnGatherFunctionalTests.cs - SH-based gather interpolation (mirror octahedral variant tests) @done
    Phase 3 - Low Priority:
      ☐ LumOnDebugFunctionalTests.cs - Debug visualization pass

  Future Enhancements (Deferred):
    ☐ Edge case: invalid probes at screen boundaries
    ☐ Edge case: depth discontinuity threshold tuning
    ☐ Edge case: sky pixels mixed with geometry
    ☐ Performance benchmarks with GPU timer queries
    ☐ Visual regression tests with image diff
    ☐ Fuzz testing with randomized inputs
