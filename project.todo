LumOn World-Space Octahedral Radiance Cache Refactor:
  This refactor aligns LumOn with UE5 Lumen's Screen Space Radiance Cache design:
  - Full world-space coordinates (positions, normals, ray directions)
  - Octahedral radiance textures instead of SH L1
  - 3D texture storage (8×8×probeCount)
  - Radiance + log-encoded hit-distance per texel
  - Temporal ray distribution (subset of rays per frame)

  Phase 1 - World-Space Probe Anchors:
    ✔ Update LumOn.02-Probe-Grid.md to document world-space storage @done
    ✔ Modify ProbeAnchor[0] to store posWS.xyz instead of posVS.xyz @done
    ✔ Modify ProbeAnchor[1] to store normalWS.xyz instead of normalVS.xyz @done
    ✔ Add inverseViewMatrix uniform to probe anchor shader @done
    ✔ Update lumon_probe_anchor.fsh to transform G-buffer VS data to WS @done
    ✔ Update lumon_probe_trace.fsh to transform WS probe data to VS for ray marching @done
    ✔ Update lumon_temporal.fsh to use WS position for reprojection @done
    ✔ Update lumon_gather.fsh to transform pixel normal to VS for SH evaluation @done
    ✔ Update all shader program C# classes with new uniforms @done
    ✔ Update LumOnRenderer.cs to pass correct matrices @done
    ✔ Build and verify compilation @done

  Phase 2 - Octahedral Radiance Texture:
    ☐ Update LumOn.03-Radiance-Cache.md to document octahedral storage
    ☐ Remove SH L1 storage and related code
    ☐ Create 3D texture with dimensions (8, 8, probeCount)
    ☐ Use RGBA16F format: RGB = radiance, A = log-encoded hit-distance
    ☐ Create lumon_octahedral.glsl include file with:
      ☐ Direction to octahedral UV conversion
      ☐ Octahedral UV to direction conversion
      ☐ Bilinear-correct octahedral sampling (edge wrap handling)
      ☐ Log-distance encode/decode helpers: log(dist + 1), exp(encoded) - 1

  Phase 3 - Ray Tracing with Temporal Distribution:
    ☐ Update LumOn.04-Ray-Tracing.md to document temporal ray distribution
    ☐ Trace subset of rays per frame (8 of 64 directions)
    ☐ Use frameIndex to select which octahedral texels to update
    ☐ Add per-probe jitter to ray subset selection
    ☐ Generate ray directions in world-space using WS normal
    ☐ Output radiance + hit-distance to 3D octahedral texture
    ☐ Add frameIndex uniform tracking in LumOnRenderer.cs

  Phase 4 - Temporal Accumulation for Octahedral:
    ☐ Update LumOn.05-Temporal.md to document per-texel accumulation
    ☐ Adapt temporal blending to work per octahedral texel
    ☐ Only blend texels that were traced this frame
    ☐ Preserve history for non-traced texels
    ☐ Use hit-distance delta for per-texel disocclusion detection
    ☐ Remove SH-specific temporal logic


  Phase 5 - Gather Pass with Octahedral Integration:
    ☐ Update LumOn.06-Gather-Upsample.md to document octahedral gather
    ☐ Replace SHEvaluateDiffuse() with hemisphere integration
    ☐ Sample octahedral tile over hemisphere aligned to pixel WS normal
    ☐ Apply cosine weighting for diffuse irradiance
    ☐ Use hit-distance for distance-aware probe weighting
    ☐ Implement leak prevention using hit-distance comparison

  Phase 6 - Performance Optimizations:
    ☐ Consider prefiltered cosine-lobe irradiance for fast diffuse gather
    ☐ Add per-texel validity mask texture for disocclusion tracking
    ☐ Profile and tune rays-per-frame (8 vs 16) based on convergence needs
    ☐ Optimize hemisphere integration sample count

  Documentation Updates:
    ✔ Revise "Why View-Space?" section in LumOn.02 to explain full world-space approach (matching Lumen for temporal stability) @done
    ☐ Add octahedral math reference to LumOn.03
    ☐ Document temporal ray distribution algorithm in LumOn.04
    ☐ Update pipeline diagrams in all affected docs
